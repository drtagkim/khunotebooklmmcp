# Hallyu Index: Comparative Analysis & Limitations

## 1. Limitations of Existing Hallyu Indices
- **Data Bias**: Heavy reliance on secondary data or limited survey samples (demographic/geographic bias).
- **Quantification Difficulties**: Challenges in quantifying the intangible "ripple effect" of culture.
- **Cultural Blindspots**: "Galapagos Syndrome" – content successful domestically may fail abroad due to cultural mismatch.
- **External Factors**: Vulnerability to political/diplomatic tensions (e.g., THAAD, bans).
- **Structural Issues**: High barriers for SMEs despite K-Brand popularity.

## 2. Areas for Improvement (Gap Analysis)
- **Data Innovation**: Incorporating real-time Big Data (Search, SNS) to supplement static surveys.
- **Indicator Refinement**: Adding "Diversity of Use", "Concentration", and "Market Share" metrics.
- **Holistic Measurement**: Expanding beyond media (Drama/K-Pop) to lifestyle (Beauty, Food, Language).
- **Strategic Segmentation**: Differentiating strategies for "Media-heavy" vs "Lifestyle-heavy" markets.
